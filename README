In our program, we attempted to take in two parameters, the dictionary file and test file.

Our program would take the dictionairy file and insert it into an array. The array would malloc and realloc if neccessary. 

Then our program would run the spell check and see if the test file we parsed through had any words that were not in the dictionary array. 

If the word was not in the array, the output would be the file where that word was parsed through, the line, and the column of the last correct character.
